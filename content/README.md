# Where do files go?
This location is read-only, as it does not really exist in your filesystem. It holds three items:

* `README.md` - this file, in Markdown format.
* [/examples](examples) — a directory of examples explaining different usages.
* [/user](user) — this is where you should place your workbooks and other files.

You will get an error if you try to save anything here or in `/examples`.
